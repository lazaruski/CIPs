# CloakX
## The first truly private and decentralised exchange.

The majority of cryptocurrency trading is conducted on centralised exchanges that provide hackers with a broad attack surface and are susceptible to a single point of failure. Trading privately and securely is increasingly difficult due to reliance on trusting a third party.

Centralised platforms are vulnerable to security threats and a single breach can compromise the assets of every user on an exchange. Many projects within the crypto space have attempted to address security and privacy issues with the implementation of a decentralised exchange (DEX).

Unfortunately, the majority of these DEX projects are not deployed to a decentralised network comprising enough individually distributed nodes. Nor do they implement any form of decentralised distribution of the user interface, the critical risk component when it comes to hacking attempts. 

Despite widespread focus on the need for decentralised exchanges, efforts are wrought with profit seeking, centralisation, the unnecessary introduction of further cryptocurrencies, and of course, fees.

### Introduction

While the value of privacy coins is dependent almost wholly on their ability to be privately spent, there are also many problems to be solved regarding how they are privately acquired. 

Careful consideration has been given to Cloak’s current technology, upcoming developments and ongoing value proposition to both the wider cryptocurrency and general consumer markets. 

### Decentralised Exchange Overview

The proposed implementation of CloakX is a decentralised exchange network built atop proof of stake nodes, that reserve a fraction of machine resources to facilitate peer to peer trading. Considering Cloak already has over 100 staking nodes and migration to the new BTC codebase is approaching completion, the network is well positioned to accommodate a DEX interface embedded directly in the new hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet.

Through each wallet connected to the network, a fraction of the exchange interface would be encrypted and stored in a distributed manner on each machine participating as a staking node. As CloakCoin does not incorporate masternodes, it naturally favours the decentralisation of the user interface, as well as the APIs of all supported cryptocurrencies.

### CloakCoin Network Utilisation

The decentralised exchange would be supported by the existing CloakCoin network. In order to access and trade using CloakX, users need to hold a certain amount of $CLOAK within their wallet, as a specified percentage (TBA) of their total trading portfolio. 

This encourages the acquisition and holding of CloakCoins. It is also inherently aligned with the inflationary properties of the coin, as the staking rewards of 6% per year provide the ‘gas’ required to incentivise further peer to peer trading on the network. 

### $CLOAK Cryptocurrency Innovation

One might consider $CLOAK serving a similar utility to CloakX, as exchange utility tokens to their respective exchanges, and in future their DEX implementations.

The upcoming release of the HD wallet and new BTC codebase, will very likely welcome integration with popular hardware wallets such as those offered by Ledger, Trezor and KeepKey. These will be a critical component for secure access to CloakX and the primary means of storage for assets traded on the network. 

Unlike other decentralised exchanges, CloakX will not require the creation of an additional token and there will be no trading fees on the DEX whatsoever. 

### CloakX Development Summary

The first implementation of CloakX could welcome trading of most of the top 100 crypto assets as a Cloak-Ethereum client. To expedite development, scale quickly with demand and access IPFS without the need to manage infrastructure, Infura is the recommended solution. 

Immediately enabling access to trading of ERC-20 tokens opens up the market for user adoption greatly and best of all, Infura is free. Also, as a truly private and decentralised implementation of a DEX, such as this on the CloakCoin network, legislative risks faced by centralised exchanges are mitigated. 

The function of CloakX is absolutely peer to peer.
